Config file
===========

The ``config.ini`` file is placed in the same directory as the SUSTAIN executable.
This file sets the file paths used in the Main window.
The purpose of this file is to let the App *remember* the user settings.
Each setting occupies one line of the file.
Currently, only two settings are save in this file.

1. baseline name file path
2. Output directory
