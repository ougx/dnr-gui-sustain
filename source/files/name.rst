SUSTAIN name file
=================

The SUSTAIN program reads a name file that contains instructions
as to which files to read and write and the parameters to control how the calculations to be performed.
A baseline name file is provided with the model files.
If you conld not find the baseline name file, please contact us for support.
Otherwise, you could follow the file format listed below to construct a new name file, or modify the example name file provided below.

Variables
---------

In the SUSTAIN name file, the lines starting with '#' are comments and will not be read by SUSTAIN.
An effective line starts with a variable name followed by the value of the variable.
Attentions:

 1. a variable and its value must and can only be separated by at least one space
 2. variable names are case insensitive
 3. The variables in the name file can appear in any order.

Below is a list of the variables that may appear in the parameter file.
Other variables not in the list will be skipped.

Global variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``PROJNAME`` *projectName*
  The ``PROJNAME`` variable is the the project name, e.g. *baseline*.

``MASTER`` *masterDir*
  The ``MASTER`` variable is used to specify the master directory.
  All other directories are set relative to the master directory.

``OUTDIR`` *outputDir*
  The ``OUTDIR`` variable specify the output directory.
  In this directory, you should find the ``RAW`` directory generated with the waterhsed model or other MODFLOW output files.
  All the new files generated by ``SUSTAIN`` will be placed in this directory.
  The output directory must created before writing any data to it.

Watershed model variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


``YEARS`` *startYear endYear*
  The ``YEARS`` variable specify the starting year and ending year of the simulation.

``CROP`` *InCropTypes*
  The ``CROP`` variable specify the crop names used in the watershed input files.

``LUCROP`` *OutCropTypes*
  The ``LUCROP`` variable specify the crop names used in the raw watershed output files.

``IRRI`` *InIrrigationTypes*
  The ``IRRI`` variable specify the crop names used in the watershed input files.

``LUIRRI`` *OutIrrigationTypes*
  The ``LUIRRI`` variable specify the crop names used in the raw watershed output files.

Groundwater model variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``MFDIS``

``MFRCH``

``MFWEL``

``MFCBB``

``MFHDS``

``MFDDN``
