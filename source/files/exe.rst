Executable and batch files
==========================

SUSTAIN Executable
------------------

SUSTAIN is developed using ``wxPython``. It also uses several packages for a range of tasks.
The SUSTAIN executable for Windows will be compiled and distributed (for other OS, please contact us) for each version.
The SUSTAIN executable is named as ``main.exe``.
With the SUSTAIN executable file, there are also other dependence files that used by SUSTAIN.
To start SUSTAIN, double-click ``main.exe`` or
the batch file ``SUSTAIN.bat`` which is a shortcut to the executable.
